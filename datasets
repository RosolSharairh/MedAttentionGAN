1.  Dataset Collection
Our research utilizes several brain MRI and CT datasets
taken from different sources that are classified into paired
and unpaired CT/MRI images.
- Paired CT-MR Datasets
We only leveraged the (MR-CT) Jordan University Hospi-
tal (JUH) dataset [23] which consists of 2D image slices
extracted using the RadiAnt DICOM viewer software. The
extracted images are transformed to jpg image data format
with a resolution of 256x256 pixels. There are a total of 179
2D axial image slices referring to 20 patient volumes.
-  Unpaired MR/CT Datasets
We combined four datasets, starting with brain CT images
with intracranial hemorrhage masks from Kaggle, that
consist of head CT images in jpg format. There are 2500
brain window images and 2500 bone window images, for
82 patients. There are approximately 30 image slices per
patient.
The second dataset we used is the CT of the
brain dataset from Kaggle, which consists of
256 CT brain scans with cancer, tumors, and aneurysm.
Each scan represents a detailed image of a patient’s brain
taken using CT. The data are presented in both .jpg and .dcm
formats.
The third is the brain tumor MRI dataset from Kaggle, that contains 3064 T1-weighted
contrast-enhanced images from 233 patients with three
kinds of brain tumor: 1. Meningioma (708 slices), 2.
Glioma (1426 slices), and 3. A pituitary tumor (930 slices).
The fourth dataset is a rich image dataset provided by
the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) for In-
tracranial Hemorrhage Detection, we used 2000 CT im-
ages from it and dowmloaded then from Kaggle.
Finally, the fifth dataset is the brain tumor MRI
dataset that contains two folders: yes and no containing 3060 brain
MRI images, where the yes file contains 1500 brain images
that are tumorous and The no file contains 1500 images that
are benign.
2. Data Preprocessing
We converted the images, from all datasets, from differ-
ent extensions to png, to unify the format among images.
Moreover, we reshaped all images to 256×256 to allow for
an easier pipeline for data processing
